Prolog
------

Do you have your RPM package sources placed in a publicly available Git or SVN repo? Would you like to build them in the most easiest way
and even automate that process? Or are you a developer that wants to get his or her work quickly published? In either of these cases, this
article is for you.

Ok, you got my attention
------------------------

Cool! Well, maybe you have already heard about [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org) build system. This is where we will be doing our
setup to automatically rebuild your packages. Why there? Because this is the place to make your work public, or if you don't want that yet,
just to test it and share the built rpm binaries with other developers. The linked COPR instance is part of Fedora Project but COPR source
code itself: <https://pagure.io/copr/copr> is distribution independant and if you want you can setup your own COPR instance for custom
purposes.

Simple Howto
------------

So let's dive into the work. Let's say you have your repo hosted at Github as me here: <https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-flat-unpacked> and
you want to make a publicly accessible RPM package that can be very easily installed by users (or fellow programmers). First you need login and
create a COPR project dedicated to build your packages. If you haven't done it before, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/).
Otherwise, let's jump immediately to the building part:

*Picture (click it to enlarge):*

<a href="/images/blog-tutorial-flat-unpacked-build.png" class="fancy">
    ![Click on me](/images/blog-tutorial-flat-unpacked-build.png){:width="740"}
</a>

*Instructions:*

1. Go to your project -> click  **Builds** -> click **New Build** -> select **SCM** tab
2. Insert `<your Git repo URL>` into **Clone URL** field
3. Click on blue **Build** button at the bottom

So the basic use-case is really this simple. You just specify Clone URL pointing to your
Git (or SVN) repo, leave the rest as is, and click the <span style="color:white; background:#005ccc; font-weight: bold; padding: 1px 4px">Build</span> button.

Notice the name of the repository: *blog-tutorial-flat-unpacked*. Now the same steps will work even for <https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-flat-packed>,
yet if you look at the content of the repository, it looks quite a bit different from the unpacked one. COPR supports building from both repository content types
and you don't need to tell it what type it is dealing with. This information is being automatically determined by the [rpkg](https://pagure.io/rpkg-client)
utilility.

You can find a real COPR build for [blog-tutorial-flat-unpacked](https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-flat-unpacked) here: <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/blog-tutorial/build/650291/>.

And for [blog-tutorial-flat-packed](https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-flat-packed) here: <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/blog-tutorial/build/656309/>.

More advanced Howto
-------------------

Now if you looked at the screenshot in the section above, you could have noticed that in the section *2. Provide the Source* there are many more configuration options than
just **Clone URL** (even though that is the only required one). Apart from boring **Type** (Git/SVN), there are things like **Committish** (branch, tag, or git hash),
**Subdirectory** (useful for layered repositories, see below), and **Spec File** (path to the RPM package metadata file). These things are all optional and if you don't
specify them in the build form, COPR will provide the following default values:

For **Type**, the default value is **Git**.

For **Committish**, the default value is **master**.

For **Subdirectory**, it is **/** (meaning root directory of the Git or SVN repository).

For **Spec File**, it is name of the file in the given **Subdirectory** that ends with `.spec` (in other words, the spec file is auto-located in the given
subdirectory if not specified).

Then there are also two other standalone configuration sections: *3. How to build SRPM from the source* and *4. Select chroots and other options*. The section
*3.* allows you to select the tool to be used for SRPM generation (out of **rpkg**, **tito**, **tito test**, **make srpm** options) and will be covered to the full
extent later. Section *4.* is shared accross all Build Forms and is so typical for COPR that it won't be covered in this tutorial
(you can read more [here](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/)).

<hr/>

Ok, we now know the default values for the individual fields in the package source section but what do they actually mean? Let's see:

- **Type**: SCM type of the repository being pointed to by **Clone URL** (in other words, whether we should use plain `git` or `git svn` for subsequent cloning).
- **Clone URL**: What repository we should clone to obtain the sources.
- **Committish**: What tag, branch, or commit we should check out from the history of the cloned repository.
- **Subdirectory**: Where the subsequent SRPM build command (see below) should be executed and where the .spec file is located. The path is relative to the repository root.
- **Spec File**: Path to the spec file relative to the given **Subdirectory**. Note that you can optionally anchor the path with **/** (e.g. **/rpm/example.spec**)
to make it relative to the repository root instead of the given **Subdirectory**.

So what happens if you put the following values into the fields:

- Type: **Git**
- Clone URL: **<https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-layered>**
- Committish: **feature-branch**
- Subdirectory: **subpkg1**
- Spec File: **my.spec**

First the **Git** repository at **<https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-layered>** is cloned and **feature-branch** is checked out.
Afterwards, the current working directory is changed to **subpkg1** and the chosen SRPM generator tool (see below) is invoked with **my.spec**
as an input parameter specifying the package spec file.

Real COPR build: <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/blog-tutorial/build/656551/>

What about this?

- Type: **Git**
- Clone URL: **<https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-layered>**
- Committish: **feature-branch**
- Subdirectory: **subpkg1**
- Spec File: **/rpm/your.spec**

The same repository is cloned and the same branch is checked out. But this time, the SRPM generator will be invoked inside **subpkg1** directory
and the tool will be fed with **/rpm/subpkg2.spec** as the path to the RPM spec file.

Real COPR build: <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/blog-tutorial/build/656553/>

Finally, let's check out this one:

- Type: **Git**
- Clone URL: **<https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-layered>**
- Committish: **22e86970f04a0a48dcebabe237e51064790965c6**
- Subdirectory: **subpkg2**
- Spec File:

Here, we demand that the specific commit **22e86970f04a0a48dcebabe237e51064790965c6** will be checked out and instead of **/rpm/your.spec**, the spec file inside **subpkg2** directory
will be used (after being auto-located based on `.spec` extension). Using a different spec file basically means a different package with different
content might be built. But this is more advanced topic and you should read more [here](How to write spec files) if you want to get more information
about how to write `spec` files and what all you can configure in them.

Advanced Howto
--------------

So far in this tutorial, we have always kept the third section *How to build SRPM from the source* untouched. That means the default SRPM generator [**rpkg**](https://pagure.io/rpkg-client) was used. Let's remind ourselves of how this section looks like:

<a href="/images/srpm-build-method-form.png" class="fancy">
    ![Click on me](/images/srpm-build-method-form.png){:width="740"}
</a>

The preselected option should be the most versatile one, allowing user to immediately build RPM package from SCM just after placing a spec file somewhere in the target repository (this is still a required step and yes, it would be nice to achieve automatic spec file generation from SCM repo one day in future).

Apart from building packages from any Git or SVN repository, [**rpkg**](https://pagure.io/rpkg-client) also supports building directly from a [DistGit](https://clime.github.io/2017/05/20/DistGit-1.0.html) repository, which is a variant of Git dedicated solely for packaging purposes. Because Fedora uses DistGit to store its packages, you can build an official Fedora package by using this method. For example, the following will build the official Fedora `prunerepo` package:

- Type: **Git**
- Clone URL: **<https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/prunerepo>**
- Committish:
- Subdirectory:
- Spec File:
- Build SRPM with: **rpkg**

Real COPR build: <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/blog-tutorial/build/656623/>

[**rpkg**](https://pagure.io/rpkg-client) is actually not only a tool for generating SRPMs but it is, in fact, a full-fledged RPM package manager, similarly to [**tito**](https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito) (coming next).

<hr/>

[**tito**](https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito) is a robust RPM package manager with lots of features. If your project is managed with Tito, then this is the tool you want to pick for SRPM generation. Let's see an example build:

- Type: **Git**
- Clone URL: **<https://github.com/spacewalkproject/spacewalk.git>**
- Committish:
- Subdirectory: **spec-tree/bootstrap-datepicker**
- Spec File:
- Build SRPM with: **tito**

Real COPR build: <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/blog-tutorial/build/656655/>

In this build, Tito looked up the latest Git tag for the subpackage at **spec-tree/bootstrap-datepicker** and used that specific commit to make an SRPM. This is the default tito mode for creating SRPMs.

Now let's see what happens if **tito test** method is selected, which is equivalent to calling `tito` with `--test` switch:

- Type: **Git**
- Clone URL: **<https://github.com/spacewalkproject/spacewalk.git>**
- Committish:
- Subdirectory: **spec-tree/bootstrap-datepicker**
- Spec File:
- Build SRPM with: **tito test**

Real COPR build: <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/blog-tutorial/build/656657/>

In this case, `tito` just builds what is currently being checked out after checkout of the specified **Committish** (default is 'master'). But that's not all to it. If you compare the resulting [builddir for the first build](https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/clime/blog-tutorial/fedora-26-x86_64/00656655-bootstrap-datepicker/) and the resulting [builddir for the second build](https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/clime/blog-tutorial/fedora-26-x86_64/00656657-bootstrap-datepicker/), the RPMS are named differently. That's because in the test mode, Tito fiddles with the provided spec file for the given subpackage and extends **Release** .spec tag with Git versioning information, which influences the resulting SRPMs as well as RPMs.

<hr/>

Finally, the last SRPM build tool in the shelf is **make srpm**. This method is the most flexible one. It allows you to e.g. generate a spec file for the subpackage on the fly or
even clone other repositories and make SRPM from their content. Let's stick to a simple example however:

- Type: **Git**
- Clone URL: **<https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-make-srpm>**
- Committish:
- Subdirectory:
- Spec File:
- Build SRPM with: **make srpm**

Real COPR build: <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/blog-tutorial/build/656672/>

For this method to work, you need to provide `.copr/Makefile` with `srpm` target in your project. 
This target will be then invoked at a dedicated builder machine inside a [mock](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock) chroot (see its `--chroot` option) 
by [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) command. Similarly to other methods, the command will be run in the specified **Subdirectory** and it will be
provided with two arguments: `outdir` and `spec`. `outdir` says where you should place the resulting generated SRPM and `spec` will be set to the **Spec File** field value
prepended with the absolute file-system path to the specified **Subdirectory**.

Now let's look at the `.copr/Makefile` file that we have used in the last build (original is at <https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-make-srpm/blob/master/.copr/Makefile>):

    srpm:
        dnf --nogpgcheck -y install rpkg --repofrompath=repo,https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/clime/rpkg-client/fedora-26-x86_64/
        echo '%dist %{nil}' > ~/.rpmmacros
        rpkg srpm --outdir=$(outdir) --spec=$(spec)

The script performs the following steps:

1. Installs the latest version of `rpkg` utility directly from a COPR repo. We disable gpgcheck for simplicity so that we don't need to install the COPR project's public key. That's not what you should normally do.
2. Sets `%dist` tag macro to `%{nil}`. This will influence **Release** of the generated SRPM because `%dist` tag is used from within the **Release** tag in the subpackage spec file.
3. Generates SRPM and places it into `$(outdir)`. The name of the generated SRPM is `example-1.0.8-1.src.rpm` instead of `example-1.0.8-1.fc26.src.rpm`.

You can find more information in this log: <https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/clime/blog-tutorial/srpm-builds/00656672/builder-live.log>.

Ok, so...how to automate any of that
------------------------------------

It's really not that difficult now. If you make any SCM build in COPR, it will auto-create a new COPR package for you with name inherited from the built SRPM package (unless a COPR package with the same name already exists). It will also copy the field values that you have specified in the Build form into the Package form. 

E.g. for the very first [build](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/blog-tutorial/build/650291/) of <https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-flat-unpacked> repository that we have made in this tutorial, it created [this package](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/blog-tutorial/package/example/): 

<a href="/images/package-view.png" class="fancy">
    ![Click on me](/images/package-view.png){:width="740"}
</a>

Note that here the word "package" denotes *COPR package*, which is different from the *subpackages* we were talking about before. Anyway, this COPR package allows you to easily replicate the original build with the same settings and can be also used to setup auto-rebuilding with webhooks.

If you click at **Edit** button in the *Default Build Source* section, you will get to the following screen:

<a href="/images/package-edit.png" class="fancy">
    ![Click on me](/images/package-edit.png){:width="740"}
</a>

There you need to ensure that the **Webhook rebuild** checkbox is being checked.

Finally, you need to follow the **Settings -> Webhooks** instruction page for your project. Let's show the screenshot from my example project that cannot be normally accessed by other users:

<a href="/images/webhook-setting-instructions.png" class="fancy">
    ![Click on me](/images/webhook-setting-instructions.png){:width="740"}
</a>

If you follow these settings specifically for Github, you should get to the screen similar to this:

<a href="/images/github-webhook-setting.png" class="fancy">
    ![Click on me](/images/github-webhook-setting.png){:width="740"}
</a>

So...let's push something now into <https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-flat-unpacked> and hope it will be auto-rebuilt...

<https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/blog-tutorial/build/656698/>

\o/

(At least the build has started, maybe it will fail)

Can I do all this by using command-line?
----------------------------------------

Yes, you can! But you need the latest python3-copr and copr-cli packages available now only in @copr/copr repo. They should [land](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-83f91bf187) in Fedora soon, however. If you have `dnf-plugins-core` installed, then you can do the following to install the latest COPR client tools (also follow the instructions here <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/api/> to get API token):

    # dnf copr enable -y @copr/copr
    # dnf install -y python3-copr copr-cli --best

and then...

    $ copr-cli create myproject --chroot fedora-26-x86_64
    New project was successfully created.
    $ copr-cli buildscm myproject --clone-url https://github.com/clime/blog-tutorial-flat-unpacked
    Build was added to myproject:
        https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/build/656705/

Of course, you can also setup the webhook with the `copr-cli` client but that's already a bit beyond the reach of this tutorial. See `man copr-cli` and the *package* interface for instructions how to do it.

Epilog
------

Well, this is a bit long tutorial but underlyingly, it's all about the idea that you can just smack any Git or SVN URL into the **Clone URL** field and that's it (except clicking the **Build** button of course). There are many more options but it's up to you if you use them or not. Oh yeah...one more thing...If you try to use the **rpkg** tool and install it from Fedora, it won't work because the Fedora version is very outdated at the moment. Update is coming soon but you can find an up-to-date version also at <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/clime/rpkg-client/>. This latest version allows building directly from Fedora DistGit forks.
